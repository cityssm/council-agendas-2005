DelBianco  Whereas since 2001, Algoma is the only District in Northern Ontario that does not have a Local Training Board to identify and facilitate community training and recruitment which is required to ensure successful economic diversification in the District; and  Whereas a skilled workforce is a critical component of any community's attempt to capitalize on its opportunities and this has been clearly identified by Destiny Sault Ste. Marie in its strategy; and  Whereas without a Local Training Board it is difficult to effectively assess and plan for the future labour market needs of our community's growth efforts; and  Whereas Sault Ste. Marie's academic and business communities, along with other neighbouring municipalities, are supportive of the development of an Algoma District Training Board,  Now therefore be it resolved that City Council supports the request of Mayor John   Rowswell   to   the   Honourable   Lucienne   Robillard,   Minister   of   Human Resources and Skills Development as set out in a letter dated March 7, 2005 and requests the Minister's assistance and support for the establishment of a Training Board for the District of Algoma similar to those currently in existence in other Districts of Northern Ontario.

Turco  Whereas Children’s Mental Health Ontario promotes, supports and strengthens a sustainable system of mental health services for children, youth and their families; and  Whereas   last   year   treatment   for   thousands   of   children   was   disrupted   and compromised because children’s mental health agencies in Ontario lost 212.6 FTE positions due to funding constraints; and  Whereas children and youth in Ontario must wait an average of 5 months for mental health treatment and there are currently over 200 children on Algoma Family Services waiting lists, where it is not uncommon for children and youth to wait   up   to   a   year   for   a   psychological   assessment   and   required   treatment services; and  Whereas a one-time injection of 3-percent to base budgets, though appreciated after 12 years of no increases, is simply not adequate to enable agencies to maintain existing staff or services; and  Whereas it is important that children in treatment be able to create and sustain trusting   relationships   with   their   child   and   youth   workers,   social   workers, psychologists and other treatment team members; and 5.   (l)   Whereas any reform efforts will fail unless there is more funding for existing core services;  Now therefore be it resolved that the City of Sault Ste.
